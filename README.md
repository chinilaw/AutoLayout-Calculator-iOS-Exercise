# AutoLayout-Calculator-iOS-Exercise
An exercise I learned in Udemy that creates a functional calculator. Inspired by the calculator on MacOS

What I Learned
- The difference between Classes and Structs
- Mutating a struct in order to create new structs with different properties
- Utilization of a tuple 
- Adding Constraints: Stacks, Fill equally/proportionally, Equal width of another object
